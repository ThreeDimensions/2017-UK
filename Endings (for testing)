From this point, it all hangs in the balance. Any hope of a strong majoirity is out at this point, all you can hope for is that 2015 repeats, the exit poll is wrong, and you overperform to eek out a majority. As the seats get counted, you remain on the edge of your seat, your campaign staffers glued to the screen as each seat comes in. But it quickly becomes clear, you’re falling way short of reaching 326 seats. It’s unlikely for you that a government can be formed. With no good coalition options available, the dreaded possibility of a Coalition of Chaos finds its way onto the table. With no good options for negotiations with the Conservatives, Parliament looks to Labour to form a government instead. For the Conservative party, a worst case scenario would be a Labour-SNP coalition. However, if they don’t manage it alone, the Liberal Democrats are also willing to work with them over preventing a Hard Brexit, if not just preventing Brexit entirely. As well, SNP in coalition will mean one thing, a certain second Scottish referendum, and the chaos that has plagued the government might make it this time that Scotland votes to leave the United Kingdom. You can only hope that Labour need the Liberal Democrats to dampen the nightmares that having the SNP in government could deliver. However, at least you have your Maidenhead constituency, and you can continue representing your constituents from the backbenches.";

If they can’t reach 326 seats together, then a Coalition of Chaos with the SNP it most likely is. For you, questions. Where did it all go wrong? Many will ask, for Labour, pretty much a victory under a candidate they didn’t have much faith in. How in six weeks you went from polls suggesting a potential landslide, to the opposition being the largest party, narrowly missing a majority. With that being said, Corbyn’s Labour party will struggle to get much done, he’s hated deeply by a significant portion of his party, so he might not last long.

A staffer says in your ear “I told you, I told you”, about the threat of a potential exodus of Conservative voters to the Liberal Democrats over Brexit. Indeed, the reality of the Conservative base in the South falling out from under the party was a threat to be realised in reality. Perhaps you played too strongly for the Northern Leave vote? After all, it was a rather unstable coalition to hold together. Tim Farron appears on the TV, jumping with joy at what this means for his party. Brexit was the winning issue for him, it was what it took to bring the Liberal Democrats to heights not seen in over a century by the Liberal Party. You watch the seats get counted, and sure enough, where there once was a big patch of deep blue, seat after seat flips amber. Likely, your own Maidenhead constituency being one of them. If that’s the case, you’re not only losing your position as Prime Minister, but also as an MP. As for the Liberal Democrat led government, what will come of it? Maybe the Conservatives can negotiate to be in coalition with them, or perhaps they’ll go to Labour and a Liberal Democrat – Labour coalition will form. Whichever it is, you’re not likely to be a major part of it. One thing’s for sure, a Hard Brexit is dead, the Liberal Democrats will negotiate to maintain integration with the EU, and perhaps in 4 or 5 years, whenever the next general election is, you can run to try to retake Maidenhead and get back into Parliament?";

Any agreement you get will probably contain at least a Hard Brexit, if not a complete withdrawal without a deal altogether. It’s likely you’ll have to make significant compromises with them in terms of their strong anti-immigration positions and social conservatism that even surpasses your own party’s, aside for traditionalist Victorian throwbacks like Jacob Rees-Mogg I suppose.
